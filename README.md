# S.O.L.I.D Principles (java examples)

* **Single responsibility principle** - A class should have only one reason to change.

* **Open/Closed principle - classes, modules, functions, etc should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

* **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Methods that use references to the base classes must be able to use the objects of the derived classes without knowing it

* **Interface Segregation Principle** - Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

* **Dependency inversion principle** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
